\section{Mathematical Formulations}

\subsection{Price Prediction Model}
The LSTM-based price prediction model with attention mechanism is formulated as follows:

\begin{equation}
h_t = \tanh(W_{hh}h_{t-1} + W_{xh}x_t + b_h)
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
y_t = W_{hy}h_t + b_y
\end{equation}

Attention mechanism:
\begin{equation}
\alpha_t = \text{softmax}(W_a \tanh(W_h h_t + W_x x_t + b_a))
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
c_t = \sum_{i=1}^T \alpha_{ti} h_i

\begin{equation}
RS = \frac{\text{Average Gain}}{\text{Average Loss}}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\text{Average Gain} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n \max(0, P_i - P_{i-1})}{n}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
MACD = EMA_{fast} - EMA_{slow}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
Signal = EMA_{MACD}
\end{equation}

\end{equation}

where:
\begin{equation}
VolatilityFactor = \begin{cases}
0.5 & \text{if } \sigma > 0.4 \\
0.75 & \text{if } 0.2 < \sigma \leq 0.4 \\
1.0 & \text{if } \sigma \leq 0.2
\end{cases}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
TrendFactor = \begin{cases}
1.2 & \text{if } |TrendStrength| > 0.1 \\
0.8 & \text{if } |TrendStrength| < 0.02 \\
1.0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
VolumeFactor = \begin{cases}
1.2 & \text{if } VolumeTrend > 1.5 \\
0.8 & \text{if } VolumeTrend < 0.5 \\
1.0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\end{equation}

0.5 & \text{if } Regime = \text{Crisis}
\end{cases}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Risk Management Metrics}

\paragraph{Stop Loss and Take Profit:}
\begin{equation}
StopLoss = EntryPrice \times (1 - StopLossPct \times VolatilityMultiplier)
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
TakeProfit = EntryPrice \times (1 + TakeProfitPct \times VolatilityMultiplier)
\end{equation}

where:
\begin{equation}
VolatilityMultiplier = 1 + \frac{\sigma_{current}}{\sigma_{historical}}
\end{equation}

\paragraph{Dynamic Thresholds:}
\begin{equation}
PredictionThreshold = \max(0.001, \min(0.02, 0.02 \times (1 - ModelAccuracy)))
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
RSIThreshold = \max(30, \min(50, 40 + (WinRate - 0.5) \times 20))

\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
ValueAtRisk = \mu_p - z_\alpha \sigma_p
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}

    \item $w_i, w_j$ are portfolio weights
    \item $\sigma_i, \sigma_j$ are asset volatilities
    \item $\rho_{ij}$ is the correlation coefficient
    \item $z_\alpha$ is the critical value for confidence level $\alpha$
    \item $f(x)$ is the probability density function
\end{itemize}
